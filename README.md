# LANCER-VTT-Macros
A collection of LANCERRPG macros, including an implementation of Save Targeting. Use of the majority of these requires the Advanced Macros module.

Big thanks to be given to @StarsofCarcosa, @MSMcFarland, and @Emmi for code snippets that I've been able to learn from to allow me to do much of this.
