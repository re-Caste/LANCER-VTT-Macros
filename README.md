# LANCER-VTT-Macros
A collection of LANCERRPG macros, including an implementation of Save Targeting. Use of the majority of these requires the Advanced Macros module.

Big thanks to be given to @StarsofCarcosa, @MSMcFarland, and @Emmi for code snippets that I've been able to learn from to allow me to do much of this.

# Core Functions
The big ticket items here are "Make Save" and "Save Effect", with "Apply Statuses" as a kicker to make them a little better. Bundled with them are templates for a generic save input macro, single target save input, and AoE save input. I've also included a macro that calls a UI to make a generic save from, allowing for any possible targeting.

A lot of this stuff is admittedly very WIP, but I'm working on making this as streamlined and easy to use as I can.

Feel free to contact me on discord either in #lancer-vtt or in DMs, and thanks for visiting the repo! <3
