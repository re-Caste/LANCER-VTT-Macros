# LANCER-VTT-Macros
A collection of LANCERRPG macros, including an implementation of Save Targeting. Use of the majority of these requires the Advanced Macros module.

# Core Functions
The big ticket items here are "Make Save" and "Save Effect", with "Apply Statuses" as a kicker to make them a little better. Bundled with them are templates for a generic save input macro, single target save input, and AoE save input. I've also included a macro that calls a UI to make a generic save from, allowing for any possible targeting.

# Other shinies
So far I've also included macros for Invading and for Skill Triggers. The invade macro seeks to streamline the process of choosing invade effects and automating any relevant macros tied to said invades (e.g. if you have a macro that applies Impaired and Slowed for Fragment Signal, my invade macro will attempt to run it). The skill trigger macro lets players make their skill rolls without having to interact with their pilot sheets, among other things that make the process smoother.

# Thanks for browsing!
Big thanks to be given to @StarsofCarcosa, @MSMcFarland, and @Emmi for code snippets that I've been able to learn from to allow me to do much of this.

A lot of this stuff is admittedly very WIP, but I'm working on making these as streamlined and easy to use as I can.

Feel free to contact me on discord either in #lancer-vtt or in DMs, and thanks for visiting the repo! <3
